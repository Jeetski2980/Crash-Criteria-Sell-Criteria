Detecting Deep Market Crashes Using SPY:
 A Strict, Confirmed Signal Approach with Trend Breakdown

What Is This?
This document outlines an enhanced rule-based system for detecting SPY market crashes.
 It improves upon the original by combining price action, volume pressure, and a trend filter to confirm true crashes and suppress early or false signals during minor pullbacks.

Crash Detection Criteria
A crash is flagged only when all of the following conditions are met:
SPY drops 6% or more within a rolling 12-trading-day window (from recent high)
 (captures short-term sharp declines)


At least one day within that 12-day window has a daily drop of 3% or more
 (indicates panic selling)


At least two additional days within a 14-day window have daily drops of 1.75% or more
 (shows sustained downward pressure)


The 14-day average volume is at least 15% higher than the prior 30-day average
 (confirms institutional-level selling through elevated trading activity)


SPY is currently -10% or more below its 8-week high
 (measures significant drawdown from recent peak; uses the highest close in the last 40 trading days)
The VIX (Volatility Index) is above 37                                                                                             (adds a volatility filter to confirm extreme market fear)


SPY is trading below its 21-day Simple Moving Average (SMA)
 (SMA represents the short-term trend; this ensures the market is in a confirmed downtrend)





Why This Version Is More Reliable
The original model triggered too early in some cases‚Äîsometimes before the market had structurally broken down.
 This updated model resolves that by requiring:
A deep drawdown from peak prices (a measurable fall from the recent high)


A confirmed short-term trend reversal (through the 21-day SMA)


Volume pressure consistent with institutional panic (large increases in traded shares)


Together, these ensure that red triangle alerts appear only after multiple layers of crash evidence are in place.

Case Study: April 2025 Crash
Date Range
Signal Shown?
Explanation
April 2‚Äì3, 2025
No
Early drop occurred, but trend had not broken
April 4, 2025
Yes
SPY dropped over 5% in a single day, triggering multiple rules
April 7‚Äì11, 2025
Yes
All crash rules met including SMA and 10% drawdown

A red triangle was shown after a 10%+ drawdown from the recent high, combined with volume pressure and trend confirmation.
 This avoided an early false signal and caught the breakdown precisely as panic accelerated.

Summary
This model filters out early or misleading signals. It only triggers when multiple indicators confirm that institutional panic and technical breakdowns are underway.
Investors using this model can confidently wait for:
Clear technical breakdowns


Sustained drawdowns


Confirmed volume pressure


Only then does the system flag true, actionable crash signals. This helps eliminate fear-based trades and positions investors to take advantage of real market reversals.

Implementation
This crash detection model has been fully implemented and backtested using Pine Script on TradingView, allowing for automated signal plotting, historical verification, and visual confirmation through red triangle markers.
 The model runs on a daily chart of SPY and filters out early noise by combining multiple time-based and trend-based conditions in real-time.
